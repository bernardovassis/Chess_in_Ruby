# Chess_in_Ruby

The Odin Project Ruby course last project

Fully functional terminal Chess Game.

Still an early build, code can still be cleaned and simplified.
I experimented a lot with Ruby in this project and didn't care much for code readability, cleanliness or coherence in choices.
I intend to update a more definitive version in the near future .
